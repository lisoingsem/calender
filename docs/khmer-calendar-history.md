# Khmer Calendar History

## Overview

The Khmer calendar system has evolved over centuries, incorporating both lunisolar and solar calculations. This document provides historical context and background information about the Khmer calendar, particularly focusing on Khmer New Year celebrations.

## Historical Background

### Pre-Angkor Era

Before the end of the Angkor era, Khmer celebrated New Year according to the lunisolar calendar. According to Zhou Daguan, the Chinese traveler to Cambodia in the 13th century, Khmer New Year occurred on the tenth month on the Chinese calendar. By running a calculation on Khmer calendar for 1295 AD (the year that Zhou Daguan recorded the event), the tenth month on the Chinese calendar corresponds to the first month on Khmer calendar.

The first month of the Khmer calendar is **Mekasay** (មិគសិរ) which falls around January or December in the Gregorian calendar. This is the New Year date which is not widely celebrated today.

### Post-Angkor Era

After the Angkorian period, Cambodians made use of both lunisolar and solar calendars. With the adoption of the new calendar system, Khmer changed its celebration as well. Many suggest that the decision to change the New Year date to April is due to civil reasons. In April, the farmers are done from their farming tasks and thus have time to rest and celebrate the New Year.

The New Year date was determined based on a type of solar calendar. If the New Year date is calculated using the Ayun Songkran (a calculation based on the lunar calendar), it is not consistent with the lunisolar calendar, but it is said that it should fall between the fourth day of the fifth and sixth month (4 Keit of Chaet and 4 Keit of Vesak).

For New Year calculation using the Samagn Songkran (a calculation based on solar calendar), the date typically falls on April 13 or 14 on the Gregorian calendar in recent years. This is the widely celebrated and official New Year for Cambodians today.

### Celebration Duration

- **Ancient times**: The celebration would last for a month; half of a month is celebrated before the New Year date and the other half after the New Year date.
- **Modern times**: The celebration lasts about the duration of the New Year, which is 3 to 4 days depending on the year.

## Two Different New Years

According to traditional sources, Cambodians celebrate two different New Years:

1. **First New Year** (not widely celebrated): On the first day of Chaet (១កើត ខែ ចេត្រ) of the Khmer lunisolar calendar. On that day, the animal year is changed to a new animal.

2. **Second New Year** (widely celebrated): Typically starts either on April 13 or April 14 of the Gregorian calendar. It lasts for three to four days depending on the year:
   - **Day 1**: Songkran (សង្រ្កាន្ត)
   - **Day 2**: Vonabot (វនប័ត) - may be 1 or 2 days
   - **Last Day**: Leungsak (ឡើងស័ក) - the day to increment Sak (Buddhist era)

## April New Year Calculation

The April New Year is based on the solar calendar system. A year is divided into 12 Reaseys (រាសី), which are divisions of the path of the Earth around the sun. These Reaseys correspond to star constellations.

Within the twelve Reaseys there is a star called **Songkran** or **Chaitra**. This star is selected as a dividing point to end the current year and start a new year. The star divides the Mena and Mesa Reasey. The Earth aligns with the star and the sun in a straight line on April 13 or 14 on the Gregorian calendar in recent years. This marks the day of the New Year.

As soon as the Earth enters Mesa Reasey, it is the first day of New Year called Songkran day.

## Songkran Sote Folklore

The story of **Songkran Sote** (សង្រ្កាន្តសូត្រ), also known as "Dhommabal" or "Kabel Moha Prom", explains the origin of the seven New Year angels.

### The Story

Once upon a time there was a rich and powerful man who had a son named **Dhammabal Koma**. Dhammabal Koma completed his formal education by the age of seven and became the wisest of all men. His wisdom and teachings were well known throughout the region.

One day, the **King of Heaven, Kobel Mohaprom**, heard of Dhammabal's reputation and became envious. The King of Heaven decided to come down and challenge Dhammabal to a test of intellectual prowess in the form of three riddles:

1. In the morning, where is happiness?
2. At noon, where is happiness?
3. In the evening, where is happiness?

If Dhammabal answered correctly, the King of Heaven would cut off his own head. On the other hand, if Dhammabal could not answer, it would be Dhammabal's head that suffers the fatal blow. Dhammabal had seven days to solve the riddles.

After much deliberation, Dhammabal realized he was no closer to solving the riddles and it was already the sixth day. Frustrated and ashamed, Dhammabal decided to flee into the forest to kill himself. On his way out of the palace, he stopped to rest under a palm tree and listened unnoticed to two eagles in deep conversation. The male eagle revealed the answers:

- **In the morning**: Happiness lies in people's faces as they splash their faces with cool water and prepare to meet the new day.
- **At noon**: Happiness is reflected on people's chests as they bathe to cool their bodies from the afternoon heat.
- **In the evening**: Happiness exudes from people's feet as they wash their feet to rest from the toils of the day and get ready for bed.

After hearing the conversation, Dhammabal Koma happily returned to the palace and awaited the King of Heaven. True to his promise, Kobel Mohaprom cut off his own head, but before doing so, he called his seven daughters to him. The King of Heaven warned that if his head were to touch the earth, the earth would catch fire; if thrown into the air, rain would cease; and if it touched the ocean, the ocean would instantly evaporate. So he asked the seven daughters to take turns carrying his head on a platter.

After these dire warnings, Kobel Mohaprom cut off his own head and handed it to **Tungsa**, the eldest daughter. Tungsa placed her father's head on a platter and took it to Mount Someru. Tungsa and a trillion other angels circled Mount Someru before bringing Kobel Mohaprom's head to Kuntheakmali temple in heaven.

Every year during the Songkran, one of the seven daughters would take turns carrying their father's head in a ceremonial circle around Mount Someru before returning to the temple in heaven. Thus, on the first day of the New Year (the Songkran date), a different New Year angel comes down to earth depending on which day of the week the Songkran date falls.

## New Year Angels

There are seven different angels that represent each of the seven days the New Year falls on:

- **Sunday**: Tungsa Tevy (ruby necklace, pomegranate flower, garuda)
- **Monday**: Koreak Tevy (pearls, Ankeabos flower, tiger)
- **Tuesday**: Reaksa Tevy (precious stones, lotus flower, horse)
- **Wednesday**: Mondar Tevy (cat's eye gemstones, fragrant flower, donkey)
- **Thursday**: Keriny Tevy (emerald, Mondea flower, elephant)
- **Friday**: Kemira Tevy (precious gems, violet flower, water buffalo)
- **Saturday**: Mohurea Tevy (sapphires, Trokeat flower, peacock)

Each angel has unique associations depending on the items they carry, animals they ride, or the food they eat. Each unique angel determines the different events destined to occur in the coming year.

## Building of Sand Hill Ceremony (Vealokchetei)

The building of sand hill ceremony, known as **Vealokchetei**, symbolizes a stupa or cone shape structure used to store human remains. The sand hill structure represents a stupa called **Cholamony Chaetdei** where hair and diadem of Buddha were buried after his entry into Nirvana.

The sand hill also symbolizes the relics of Buddha in India. The center of the big sand hill represents **Mount Meru** that stands for the center of the world. The other small hills represent the seven mountains that surrounded Mount Meru. Khmer people believe that each grain of the sand give the merit to those who perform this ceremony to be relieved of their misfortunes.
